VirtueNet - Your Digital Sanctuary from Online Harassment
The aim of this project is how to complain for Online Harassment/Abusive Posts which we encounter in real life. We simply click on report on the post but we have to wait for the resolution. In VirtueNet, you will upload the post(Video/Image), then it will analyse the data and checks if it has any abusive/harassive words in it. Based on that, it will give info whom to contact.
